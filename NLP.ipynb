       "['This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.',\n",
       " 'Mac Watson honors the memory of a wine once made by his mother in this tremendously delicious, balanced and complex botrytised white. Dark gold in color, it layers toasted hazelnut, pear compote and orange peel flavors, reveling in the succulence of its 122 g/L of residual sugar.',\n",
       " \"This spent 20 months in 30% new French oak, and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards, among others. Aromatic, dense and toasty, it deftly blends aromas and flavors of toast, cigar box, blackberry, black cherry, coffee and graphite. Tannins are polished to a fine sheen, and frame a finish loaded with dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now through 2032.\",\n",
       " \"This re-named vineyard was formerly bottled as deLancellotti. You'll find striking minerality underscoring chunky black fruits. Accents of citrus and graphite comingle, with exceptional midpalate concentration. This is a wine to cellar, though it is already quite enjoyable. Drink now through 2030.\",\n",
       " 'The producer sources from two blocks of the vineyard for this wine—one at a high elevation, which contributes bright acidity. Crunchy cranberry, pomegranate and orange peel flavors surround silky, succulent layers of texture that present as fleshy fruit. That delicately lush flavor has considerable length.',\n",
       " 'From 18-year-old vines, this supple well-balanced effort blends flavors of mocha, cherry, vanilla and breakfast tea. Superbly integrated and delicious even at this early stage, this wine seems destined for a long and savory cellar life. Drink now through 2028.',\n",
       " 'A standout even in this terrific lineup of 2015 releases from Patricia Green, the Weber opens with a burst of cola and tobacco scents and accents. It continues, subtle and detailed, with flavors of oranges, vanilla, tea and milk chocolate discreetly threaded through ripe blackberry fruit.',\n",
       " \"With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral. All these elements are in good proportion and finish with an appealing silky texture. It's delicious already, but give it another decade for full enjoyment. Drink now through 2028.\",\n",
       " \"First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028.\",\n",
       " \"This blockbuster, powerhouse of a wine suggests blueberry pie and chocolate as it opens in the glass. On the palate, it's smooth and seductively silky, offering complex cedar, peppercorn and peppery oak seasonings amidst its dense richness. It finishes with finesse and spice.\",\n",
       " 'This fresh and lively medium-bodied wine is beautifully crafted, with cherry blossom aromas and tangy acidity. Layered and seductive, it offers a crisp mix of orange peel, cherry, pomegranate and baking spice flavors that are ready for the table or the cellar.',\n",
       " \"The apogee of this ambitious winery's white wine efforts, this bottling of just two barrels of Clone 5 shows focused marzipan, marcona almond and white peach notes on the nose. The palate sizzles with saltiness and a lemony acidity that cuts through its brown butter richness with finesse. The finish is luxurious and long.\",\n",
       " 'San Jose-based producer Adam Comartin heads 1,100 feet up into the mountains to source fruit for this tremendous wine, which offers wild cherry, sage, and eucalyptus scents on the nose. Ripe black plum and strawberry fruit lead the palate, followed by acid-driven waves of juniper, pine and bay leaf, finishing with a menthol-like sensation.',\n",
       " 'Yields were down in 2015, but intensity is up, giving this medium-bodied, silky wine the potential to drink well through at least 2025. Hickory smoke outlines white peach before ending in a long flurry of lime zest.',\n",
       " 'Bergström has made a Shea designate since 2003, intent on showcasing a “pretty” style of the vineyard. Here are lovely aromatics, with grape jelly, rose petals and plum in the nose, and a complex run of red fruits in the mouth. Streaks of cola, brown sugar and more come up in a generous finish.',\n",
       " \"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha.

       " 'Bright orange juice, dill herbs and a slight whiff of vanilla bean lead the aromas on this un-oaked Chard. On the palate, flavors of apple cider come with a wash of fresh lime juice on the back end.',\n",
       " 'Taking time to come around aromatically, it opens up with plum and bright red cherry fruit that follow on the palate, a touch of savory tobacco suggested around the tannins. On the finish expect a balance of spice and sweet as black pepper and caramel compete for affection.',\n",
       " 'Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish.',\n",
       " 'The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice. It bristles with acidity, pleasant to sip on its own or with bacon-wrapped figs.',\n",
       " \"The winery's signature widely distributed white is heady in flowery jasmine, with vibrant acidity and a sense of sweetness on the palate thanks to fresh fruit flavors of grapefruit, peach and nectarine. An ideal wine for summer or whenever one needs to recall a summer's day.\",\n",
       " 'Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors. Hold onto this one until 2016 for maximum enjoyment, as more flavors will emerge.',\n",
       " 'Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper. The meaty wine really gets your attention once sipped, with boysenberry, cracked peppercorn, some iron and a lingering licorice flavors.',\n",
       " \"A lemon-scented, crisp wine, it's also full of ripe yellow fruits. It's a warm in style, rich with both fruit and an open texture. Almonds and acidity give a refreshing aftertaste.\",\n",
       " \"There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity. Flavors of baked black fruits, fig paste, chocolate and herbs follow the nose, as does a chocolaty, rich  finish. Drink through 2016.',\n",
       " 'Packed with tannin, it is not showing much sign of fruit yet. It is dark, brooding and very firm in texture, with just with a hint of juicy black cherry flavors. Wait until 2017 before drinking.',\n",
       " \"A very fruity wine, it shows rich wood flavors as well as equally rich fruit. It is complex, very mineral in character, tight and nervy. The citrus fruit is matched by the apricot flavor, putting down layers of acidity. Don't drink before 2017.\",\n",
       " 'The southern Napa Coombsville area is near San Pablo Bay, making it a cool area. In this vintage, it shows the acidity and mineraity of its terroir, but also the ripeness Chardonnay can achieve in a good vineyard, with orange and apricot flavors enhanced with oak. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
       " \"A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley. The vintage was difficult, but the wine is rich in raspberry, cranberry and persimmon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity and finishing totally dry. There's no reason not to drink it now.\",\n",
       " \"The minty aromas indicate new wood aging as well as a ripe, polished texture. They make for a wine that has presence and structure as well as rich fruitiness, blackberry flavors and a dry, solid core. It's a sophisticated wine that can age. Drink from 2017.\",\n",
       " 'Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing. It also has excellent acidity. But the tannins are astringently strong, giving a numbing sting to the palate. This certainly needs time. Give it until 2022 and beyond.',\n",
       " \"Right out of the bottle, this 100% Syrah delights for its overall balance and deep, rich array of cherries and blueberries. If you pay attention, you'll find more complex layers of sautéed wild mushrooms, grilled prosciutto and toast. Dry and tannic, and would be ideal with roasted lamb.\",\n",
       " 'There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink.',\n",
       " 'Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " 'This is a ripe and smoothly textured wine. It is already finely balanced, rich with toast, apricot fruits and a tight, mineral character. It is enjoyable now but will age well until 2022.',\n",
       " 'Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity. Entry is surprisingly soft, and (perhaps influenced by the name) there seems to be a pleasing clay-like quality to the mouthfeel. Clean blueberry fruit leads into a tasty, balanced finish.',\n",
       " 'Still firm and closed, this is a structured wine, solidly tannic with just hints of fruit. It has a dry feel to it, firm, the acidity and red fruits coming through the leathery, dark texture. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2017.',\n",
       " \"This is a gigantic Syrah, a tsunami of blackberry jam and milk chocolate, with headier notes of cassis liqueur and toasty buttered oak. That sounds sweet, but the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are thick, but finely ground and negotiable now. It might last in the bottle for many years, but there's no point in aging it. Enjoy now with elaborate roasts and stews.\",\n",

       " \"De Loach continues to impress with this Lake County vineyard-designate, a well-balanced Zin with plenty of density amid its brick tar and brambly blackberry fruit. With leveled acidity along with plenty of power, it'll both age and be pleasing to drink now, with smoky meats.\",\n",
       " \"This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel.

       " \"Entirely estate grown from dry-farmed grapes, this white sparkles with waxy apricot and pear flavors and crisp, underlying mineral stoniness. Dry, with refreshing acidity, it doesn't skimp on mouthfeel, delivering a viscosity that's invitingly complex and lingering.\",\n",
       " 'This complex and fragrant wine opens with dried violet, black plum and cooking spice aromas. The smooth, well-structured palate doles out blackberry jam, pipe tobacco, ripe black cherry, nutmeg and licorice flavors. Velvety tannins provide elegant support. Drink through 2027.',\n",
       " 'From a combination of dry-farmed estate fruit and grapes sourced in Carneros, this lovely white is fermented in stainless steel, which coaxes a seamless, light-bodied crispness on the palate. Exotic white peach and briny stone highlight a heady aromatic thread of honeysuckle, ginger and wild vanilla.',\n",
       " \"Winemaker Bill Brosseau hits a single vineyard home run with this bottling from one of the Central Coast's oldest sites. It shows exotic plum, tangy cranberry, pine needle, juniper and pencil shaving scents on the nose. The palate is steeped in mulberry, marjoram and curry-like Indian spices, proving dynamic and delicious in the most compelling ways.\",\n",
       " 'Yields were down in 2015, but intensity is up, giving this medium-bodied, silky wine the potential to drink well through at least 2025. Hickory smoke outlines white peach before ending in a long flurry of lime zest.',\n",
       " \"The estate's 13 acres were first planted in 1999. This lovely wine expresses itself with perfectly ripened black-cherry fruit, a dash of cola, and an underpinning of clean earth, complemented with a touch of mineral. The finish is superb.\",\n",
       " 'Consistently outstanding Pinot Noir producer Black Kite has done it again. This bottling comes together in a seamless symphony of aromas and flavors. Ripe fruit, subtly spicy oak and forest floor notes fill the glass. Its opulent texture unfolds into layers of baking spice, earthiness, and red and black cherry fruit, with a long, complex finish.',\n",
       " 'Powerful tannin meets subdued fruit in this layered, youthful wine. Concentrated and focused, with rose petal, sage and wild strawberry notes, it holds back teasingly before slowly unraveling to reveal velvety texture and corpulent weight.',\n",
       " 'There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish.',\n",
       " 'From the famous site on Westside Road outside of Healdsburg, this bold red shows orange, dark cherry and pungent earth scents, remaining savory at its core. Medium-bodied and balanced with acidity, it takes on a meaty persona seasoned with pepper, clove and black tea.',\n",
       " 'This impressive 100% varietal wine shows focused red fruit, a tropical edge of coconut and firm, structured tannin. Sage, cedar, tobacco and black pepper notes provide a sultry, savory counterpoint to the fruit, balanced with moderate acidity. Enjoy 2023–2033.',\n",
       " 'This gorgeous wine deftly integrates a lively mix of currant, cherry, breakfast tea and dried leaves into a seamless and seductive whole. Produced from vines dating back to the early 1970s, it finishes with a delicious streak of milk chocolate. Drink now through 2030.',\n",
       " 'From a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention. Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish.',\n",
       " 'Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive. Dense with fruit and detailed with wet stone minerality, this should be cellared a few years, and consumed from 2020 to 2030.',\n",
       " 'The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background. The palate is surprisingly fruit forward, with plum and savory flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish glides for a full 30 seconds.',\n",
       " \"Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha. This is proportionally big, with cheek-grabbing tannins, but it's not overly hard or unbalanced— just the opposite. Flavors of mocha, coffee, hazelnut and ripe berry fruits finish flush, dense and firm, with toasty notes and powerful but controlled residual tannins. Drink through 2030.\",\n",
       " \"This single-vineyard estate wine is made by Nils Venge and Tom Rinaldi, who have somehow managed to capture quiet elegance and powerful fruit at the same time. Red-fruit driven, it's round and rich, with moderate tannin and cassis, clove and black pepper highlights.\",\n",
       " 'Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down. Drink through 2023.',\n",
       " 'Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging.',\n",
       " \"Juicy, sun-kissed grapefruits and apple blossoms explode from this buoyantly fresh, off-dry Kabinett. Invigorating acidity lends backbone and a steely focus that resonates long on the finish. It's beautiful now, but should hold nicely, and perhaps improve, through 2020.\",\n",
       " \"Dense, rich red fruit belies an elegant wine that finds balance despite the concentration of vanilla and berry. Soft, approachable and integrated tannin and oak let the whole exist as one, instead of separate parts. This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality.\",\n",
       " \"From the Lovall Valley section of the Napa Valley quite near Sonoma, this lovely wine is awash in tropical mango, with lilts of pear and vanilla. Creamy, it's made in a fuller-bodied style but never gets ridiculous, instead offering balance and elegance, finishing with a squeeze of grapefruit.\",\n",
       " \"This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate. The berry/cherry fruit is nicely adorned with toasty barrel flavors, and it's as satiny as new sheets. You'll find it hard to keep from gulping this by the glassful.\",\n",
       " 'A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility.',\n",
       " 'Bittersweet at first, with sizable tannins, this Cab also contains 13.8% Petit Verdot. Red and black berries give it a juicy palate atop dusty, chalky tannins and a richness of leather and clove on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.',\n",
       " 'Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery. Pencil lead kicks off the palate, which then opens into poached apples and lemon oil, laid across a sizzling acidity that lasts long.',\n",
       " \"Lemony and light on entry, this tropically kissed, textured white develops body and weight over time, finding a balance and elegance that's hard to ignore. A touch of white peach wraps up the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Caramelized white peach, salted lemon, pear skin, red apple and the hint of white flowers show on the nose of this wine by these longtime but under-the-radar producers. The palate blends orange skins and grapefruit pith with buttered toast, sea salt and a dill-like herb character.',\n",
       " \"A limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco. The pretty fruit leads into darker notes of tar and espresso. Still young and primary, the Juliard may be among the vintage's most long-lasting wines.\",\n",
       " 'This is a very lively wine with a creamy mousse. The wine is towards dry, bringing out great white and citrus fruit flavors with a burst of tangy acidity. It comes from the village of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, which gives the wine a tight mineral texture at the end.',\n",
       " 'Restrained aromas of black plum barely set the stage for flavors of dark plum, cherry-vanilla, mint eucalyptus and ground black pepper. Fruit flavors are soft, but the minty notes never overpower brightness and acidity. Tannins are just shy of opulent, and the finish is marked by a note of tart apple crispness.',\n",
       " 'Creamy on the nose, this wine shows seared pineapple, apple custard, lemon oil and faint iodine aromas. The flavors are evenly placed between lemon yogurt and salted apples, mixing a bit of tang and ripe fruit with a savory sea salt.',\n",
       " 'Lush aromatics conjure up dreams of strawberry cream. This is quite pretty, with perfect balance among its components of fruit, acid and tannin, set comfortably in a compact frame.',\n",
       " 'Cedar, cherry, black olive, wet earth, green olive and freshly plucked plum pop on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of ripe black cherry down the middle, but is surrounded by a tangy green olive and an underripe-berry character, whose tartness enlivens the mouth.',\n",
       " 'The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game.',\n",
       " 'This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels. It is solid and firm while also having great swathes of raspberries and red plums laced together with acidity. The aftertaste is perfumed with a fresh lift. Drink from 2018',\n",
       " 'This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins.

       " \"Planted with eight grapes, including the three Pinot “sisters”—Blanc, Gris and Noir—this site is located just below Archery Summit in the heart of the Dundee Hills.

       " 'From several vineyard sites and combining all five red Bordeaux varieties, this wine is fermented in stainless steel before it rests over two years in both French and American oak.

       " \"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show.

       " 'A brand new vineyard designation for the winery, Bedrock dates to the 1800s and is being made famous by proprietor Joel Peterson of Ravenswood and his son, Morgan Twain Peterson.

Best the second day after opening, if one can wait.',\n",
       " 'This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose.

       " 'Offered in a half-bottle size, this estate Cab-based wine also contains 6% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. The blend is crisp, dry and tannic in cranberry, barely ripe cherry and dried currant, swerving savory into dried herb and clove.',\n",

There is a slightly dominant eucalyptus flavor that backs off at the finish, replaced by a fresh cherry juice flavor.',\n",
       " \"Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage.

       " 'Dark black cherry in color, this wine offers a bouquet of cherry preserves, matchstick and petrol.

       " 'Wreaths of smoke surround pretty raspberry aromatics. The red and plummy purple-fruit flavors continue, along with some tannic muscle and grip. This is a mix of 667 and Pommard clones—still young and a bit tight.',\n",
       " \"This was the first winery to make a truly white Pinot Noir (back in 2004). Produced exclusively from Pommard clones, it's barrel fermented and aged much like a Chardonnay. Along with great texture and length, there's plenty of acid supporting its palate-pleasing mix of white peach, melon and gooseberry. It finishes with a thread of lightly buttery caramel.\",\n",
       " \"Like many of the winery's bottlings, this wine shows rich but balanced concentration. Loamy and fulfilling baked blueberry and blackberry aromas are laced with vanilla. The palate is lavish as well, with strong blueberry syrup, herb and pepper flavors and a caramel touch on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'This new offering, made by Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson, is intended as a “best of the west.” Sourced from several vineyards, it reveals true coastal qualities, with ethereal earthiness and an Old World sensibility. Cloudy in the glass, it shows cranberry, orange, bay leaf and tea flavors as it unwinds.',\n",
       " \"Bryan Babcock makes plenty of more expensive Pinot Noirs, but this appellation blend hits all the right notes and shows off the results of the “pedestular cane suspension” technique he's been using in the vineyard. Wild thyme, sagebrush and bay leaf meet cranberry and slate aromas on the nose. Black raspberry and cranberry flavors lead the earthy palate, accented with nettle and peppercorn.\",\n",
       " 'In French, the vineyard name means “the meadow on the mountain,” a fitting name for the site. This is a spicy wine, with a touch of red-hot candy.

       " 'The top wine from this estate is impressive. It has rich black fruits and firm tannins, showing its youthfulness. Its weight and concentration combine with the ripe fruits to give a wine that is destined for long-term aging. Négrette, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon go into this fine blend. Drink it from 2020.',\n",
       " \"Though labeled Willamette Valley, this is single vineyard Chehalem Mountains AVA fruit.

       " 'This bottling from Syrah legend Bob Lindquist, sourced from the biodynamic vineyard that he planted, delivers snappy boysenberry, white pepper, rosemary and lavender aromas.

       " \"The Daou brothers' considerable and continual investments is evidence that their wines will matter for years, ensuring a wise investment today. This 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot offers aromas of blueberry and cedar. Once sipped, the tannins grab with strength before dissipating smoothly.

       " 'A smoky oak fire meets cooked meats and plum sauce on the nose of this wine, which retains great balance even at 16% alcohol.

       " 'In 1978, Zaca Mesa became the first winery to plant Syrah in Santa Barbara County, and Winemaker Eric Mohseni keeps pushing the quality. This offers notes of blueberry cobbler, rocks and fresh-turned soil, followed by blue fruit flavors, dark chocolate, leather and slight asphalt.',\n",
       " 'The wine is intense, full in the mouth and rich. The warm, concentrated character brings out both ripe fruits and minerality. The result is a textured wine, tangy and citrus-driven, that also has broad yellow fruits along with the final acidity. Drink from 2016.',\n",
       " 'Berry aromas are a touch dusty and floral on the nose, with hints of earth and cedar. On the palate, this wine is bright and balanced, with fresh acidity. Rich berry, cassis and spice flavors finish agile and long. Drink through 2016.',\n",

Aged in all new American barrels, it shows aromas of coriander, cumin and smoke, with flavors like black cherry and black pepper.

Alberello Imports, Ionia Atlantic Imports.\",\n",

       " \"The vineyard is in the Santa Maria Valley, and has been source for many years of great Pinots for multiple wineries lucky enough to obtain its fruit.

       " 'Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " 'What jumps out immediately is a bright spicy scent. The forward fruit is a zesty mix of cranberry, guava and citrus, and the flavors just punch up the palate in a most delicious way. Drink this over the next couple of years while it retains its freshness.',\n",
       " 'Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " 'From Old Wente clones grown on the famous vineyard, this full-bodied, textured wine shows ripe elements of golden honey, Gravenstein apple and toasted vanilla oak. Along the way, it flirts nicely with pear and marzipan, finishing in balanced minerality.',\n",
       " 'This wine comes from one of the best vineyard sites in Savigny-lès-Beaune, on the slope closest to Beaune. It is a smooth, perfumed and ripe wine that has a balanced structure under the bright red-cherry flavor. Still bursting with young fruit, the wine will age, so wait to drink until 2019.',\n",
       " \"When a rosé pushes past 14% alcohol, that's an indication of a pretty potent wine. Here's a fine example, showcasing ripe strawberry and peach fruit, with excellent concentration and mouth-filling flavors. Using all free-run juice, this is fresh and full-bodied.\",\n",
       " \"Gentle spice and redcurrant notes promise a subtle wine. The palate does not disappoint and sings with translucent, light-footed elegance. This is all about charm and ease, about chiffon rather than velvet. Crisp freshness brightens and lightens everything. It's a mere whiff of a wine but a delicious one.\",\n",
       " 'A dense, leathery, richly stylized wine from a great vineyard site, this offers thick layers of dark chocolate, blueberry and plum. Integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it delivers concentration and power, capped off on the finish in a shot of cigar.',\n",
       " 'From a small, 15-acre property, this wine is ripe, rich and full of yellow fruits along with crisp apples, with a tight texture that needs to develop. It is crisply structured, zesty and mineral in character. Give this juicy, delicious wine until 2017 before drinking.',\n",
       " 'This outgoing and full-bodied wine has a lot going for it. Fruity, enticing aromas lead to fully ripe flavors that suggest plums and fresh strawberries, with a suave and supple texture.',\n",
       " \"This Oregon-based producer has sourced Petaluma Gap grapes to craft a light, clear and somewhat smoky and full-bodied expression of the variety. It's dense and rich in black cherry, currant and cola-vanilla.\",\n",
       " 'This is an estate-grown, co-fermented field blend of Zin with Cabernet Franc, Alicante Bouschet, Petite Sirah, Grand Noir de Calmette, Peloursin, Lenoir, Merlot and Mourvèdre made in a small amount. Powerful tannin and leather are the stars, along with flavors of cigar, black pepper, cherry and orange.',\n",
       " 'Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, this boasts aromas of black currant, mature plum, black pepper and clove. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and Mediterranean brush accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.',\n",
       " 'Deep ruby red to the eye, this red wine has a nose of cherry, pomegranate and lemon peel. It comes on bright, offering flavors of cherry, peach, eucalyptus, rose petal and pencil lead. Velvety tannins coat the palate into a finish that is a luscious mélange of cherry and orange zest with a touch of mint.',\n",
       " \"This wine is a field blend of 80% Zinfandel, with 10% Petite Sirah, 6% Alicante Bouschet and 4% other mixed black grapes. High-toned in plum and dark cherry, it's bright while also being plush and juicy. This is a small-production offering from a fairly cool area for the grape.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Saperavi and 5% Rara Neagra has aromas of red raspberry, violet candy and black cherry. There are flavors of cherry vanilla and pomegranate with soft tannins and an elegant finish.',\n",
       " \"This wine has a compelling earthy funkiness that's both varietal and fun, a tangle of red fruit, sassafras and cardamom that's light and bright. It makes a great companion to food.\",\n",
       " 'Berry, herb and baking spice aromas lead the nose. The palate brings fleshy plum, cherry and coffee flavors that linger on the finish. This wine provides great easy-drinking appeal.',\n",
       " 'The aromas of earth, char and dark berries are alluring. The flavors are rich but never lose their deftness.',\n",
       " \"This is a robust, full-bodied and sultry wine, one within the producer's single-vineyard series, from a well-known and respected site. Oak and candied black cherry sit atop an abundance of cola spice and earthy truffle, promising more to come as it opens in the glass.\",\n",
       " 'The cherry, herb and barrel spice aromas are quite brooding at present. The fruit flavors are all about elegance of expression, showing pleasing complexities and plenty of hang time on the finish.',\n",
       " 'This Bulgarian Pinot Noir offers the nose black and red cherries and dried violets. It is well balanced in the mouth with soft, rounded tannins and flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and dried Mediterranean herbs.',\n",
       " 'There are not many châteaux in Sancerre—this is one of only four. Surrounding the building, vines produce this fresh, crisp and tightly fruity wine that has a strong minerality along with a lively, tangy character. The wine is attractive already, although it will be better from 2017.',\n",
       " \"Tire rubber, herb and locked-up barrel spice notes are followed by bountiful yet elegant black fruit flavors that show a spot on sense of balance along with exquisite length. There's no hiding the warm vintage it comes from but it shows the year well.\",\n",
       " 'From a parcel of 25-year-old vines, this is a concentrated, firm wine that needs to age. It has good potential with its tight, steely character and smoky edge. The fruitiness comes from the organic and biodynamic grapes that give richness as well as a final fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " 'The name of the wine (land of the angels) is inspired by the fact that monks first planted the slope. More prosaically, it is a delightful wine, fresh and crisp with tight acidity that promises to soften to bring out the citrus and ripe pear flavors. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " 'Ripe and creamy, this has rich pear and apple fruits lightly cut by more lemon flavors. The wine is fruity, textured with minerality and still young. Drink from 2017.',\n",

       " 'Plump and succulent, the 2015 Hunting Hill displays attractive notes of hickory smoke and white peach, underscored by the suggestion of citrus custard. Like all of the 2015 Chardonnays from Kumeu River, it shows great length and intensity.',\n",
       " 'Toasty blackberry and prune are the key aromas on this plush Cabernet. A generous mouthfeel includes choppy tannins that will mellow in due time. Dark flavors of cassis and blackberry include spice and chocolate notes, while this finishes with ripe flavors of blackberry touched up by chocolaty oak. Drink this calm, slightly flabby Cab through 2021.',\n",
       " \"Consistently one of New Zealand's top Chardonnay producers, Neudorf flies the standard for Nelson, almost next door to better-known Marlborough. The medium-bodied 2014 Chardonnay begins with appetizing scents of toast, oak spice and white peach. On the palate, there's a lovely combination of spice and stone fruit, then lingering citrus on the finish. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
       " 'This bottling from McMurray Vineyard at Rancho Sisquoc packs all of the beloved Syrah characteristics: ripe plum, blackberry and blueberry fruit, a vanilla-laced oaky frame and underlying hints of lavender and pepper. The palate offers herb and pepper touches, underscoring its black fruit and caramel flavors.',\n",
       " 'Aromatic and lushly scented with rhubarb, strawberry, cola, root beer and cocoa powder, this is immediately accessible, and yet structured to age if you can keep your hands off of it. Streaks of beet root sneak in around raspberry and cherry fruit, with firm tannins and highlights of toast, coffee, caramel and dark chocolate. This is a very fine cuvée that seems to gain focus as it rolls through the finish.',\n",
       " \"Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling. It's quite soft on the palate, with black plum and hoisin sauce flavors accenting its core of dried purple fruit, black pepper and bacon fat. The finish offers a touch of maple syrup.\",\n",
       " \"Foley's Chardonnays always manage to be both extremely tense yet flavorful—a combination that will please many palates. This bottling recalls grapefruit, mandarin pith and Asian pear on the nose, its nervy, mineral-driven palate awash with chalk and wet slate notes. It all finishes on a pleasing twist of lime.\",\n",
       " 'Tropical pineapple and guava flavors are restrained and balanced in this bright, soft and seductively smooth vineyard designate. Its high-toned acidity delivers stone and lemon peel characteristics, finding more citrus-tinged focus on the finish.',\n",
       " \"This wine is 53% Merlot and 47% Cabernet Sauvignon. Pleasing aromas of spices, herb, moist earth, cedar and cherry lead to a dazzling mouthful of cherry and strawberry flavors that show distinctive purity. It's a heart-stopper and an outrageous value.\",\n",
       " 'From a small 19-acre estate, this is a fruity and juicy blend of Braucol and the still rare Prunelard. It has a tannic stalky edge that suggests the wine can still develop. This serious concentrated wine was made in egg-shaped cement tanks and is from organic grapes. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " 'Soft and supple on the palate, this impressive wine is lightly spiced with dust and clove, its tannins rounded and in support of lingering cassis and red cherry flavors. Mocha and tobacco lend additional depth and complexity as it unfolds, punctuated by juicy acidity.',\n",
       " 'Pure and vibrant dark and red cherry notes create an irresistible nose. The palate displays the same, invitingly juicy fruit. This is supple, slender, fresh and plump, with a joyful, balanced ripeness. Its tannins are smooth and ripe, ready to enjoy.',\n",
       " \"This block selection hews closer to more conventional Oregon Pinots than the rest of the winery's portfolio, with powerful focused black-cherry fruit at its heart. It was fermented with native yeast and spent 17 months in barrel, 12% new. Those flavors come through in deft touches of graham cracker and cocoa powder, underscored with a wet-cement minerality.\",\n",
       " 'Dark in color and offering opulent aromas of crème brûlée and marshmallow, this vineyard-designate is marked by its wealth of orange blossom aromas, an inviting, floral entry. While it exudes richness on the nose, it remains much more restrained and dry on the palate, finishing with leanness and length.',\n",
       " 'Sanguine in red plum, clove and dark chocolate, this bottle-aged, full-bodied wine is impressive and still quite ripe and robust. The tannins are prominent and supported by a girth of oak, with a dense, concentrated finish.',\n",
       " \"Complexity and varietal character come through in this concentrated, well-balanced and smoothly polished wine. It is full bodied and lightly tannic, but so oozing with flavors that it's still easy to sip. The array of black plum, light sage, and black olive flavors is accented with very light oak.\",\n",
       " 'This wine has a bouquet of cassis, violet and black pepper. Well-integrated flavors of cassis, strawberry preserves, anise, fennel bulb and lavender are set amid silky tannins that feel as if they may go on forever but are surpassed at the finish when fruit flavors pull out all the stops.',\n",
       " 'This spent 18 months in 50% new French oak, which underscores its pretty berry/cherry fruit with a vein of dark chocolate. Dr Pepper and spicy herbs decorate a solid midpalate that flows into a lengthy finish with confectionary highlights.',\n",
       " 'Succulent in red cherry and cassis, this wine has a surprising level of depth and grip. It finds its way with integrated tannins, soft layers of caramelized oak and a brightness of fruit and acidity.',\n",
       " \"A twist of clove, fig and chocolate figure into this powerful, concentrated wine, with baked plum, tobacco and maple taking on secondary roles. It's full bodied and thick, so pair appropriately. It finishes in black pepper.\",\n",
       " 'A red-violet color, this wine has a bouquet of blackberry, lilac and pencil lead with a whiff of iodine. A network of velvety tannins and a vein of bold acidity are equally weighted, wrapped around flavors of blackberry, blueberry, black pepper, rose petal and Mediterranean herbs, with bright fruit persisting into the pleasing finish.',\n",
       " \"This low-alcohol rosé spent five months in neutral oak, yielding additional complexity and an appealing creaminess to the finish. Strawberry and cherry flavors are accompanied by lighter hints of peaches and sweet spices. It's a thoroughly modern, delicious rosé.\",\n",
       " 'This is definitely a light vintage for this vineyard-designate. It deftly mixes cranberry and raspberry fruit with hints of wet stone. Proportionate, drying tannins line the finish.',\n",
       " 'Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt does wonders with this consistent vineyard source, coaxing out mocha-chocolate, black cherry and blackberry, never overpowering an earthy back note of tobacco. Medium-bodied and soft, it finishes in a swirl of smoke and is juicy and enjoyable now.',\n",
       " \"Enticing notes of brioche and baker's yeast waft from this brut-style Riesling Sekt. It's perfumed and floral, yet elegantly composed, drenching the palate in waves of fresh grapefruit and lime. Piercing and pristine, it finishes with crystalline precision.\",\n",
       " \"A few swirls of the glass release engaging aromas of baking spice, red berry, rose and a whiff of tar. The linear, elegantly structured palate boasts bright wild cherry, white pepper, cinnamon and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity and assertive but refined tannins. It's still rather austere but should blossom into a beauty after a few more years in the cellar. Enjoy after 2019.\",\n",
       " \"Lifted honeysuckle and jasmine perfume abound throughout this textbook Mosel Kabinett. Sun-kissed apricots and peaches burst on the palate, yet maintain a graphite edge of minerality and acidity. It's a crystalline fruity wine that's irresistible now for its youthful exuberance.\",\n",
       " 'Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.',\n",
       " 'From what is now an estate property, once known as the Nugent Vineyard, Winside is brawny and brooding in wild strawberry compote, dark plum, blackberry and an inviting lushness. High-toned acidity keeps it from becoming overly dense on the palate. Strong tannin on the finish reflects a high-tannin vintage overall.',\n",
       " 'Horsey plum and pie cherry aromas include a whiff of latex gloves and Band-Aid. This feels rather raw and acidic, with bite. Salty sharp red-fruit flavors finish herbal, with tartaric shear.',\n",
       " 'This light-bodied wine from a cool vintage wine shows jammy raspberry with hints of leather on the nose. It may have already peaked.',\n",
       " 'The volatiles are quite amped on this wine. It makes it a struggle to get at the tart black cherry flavors.',\n",
       " 'A light, almost thin wine, this hints at green fruit, white stone fruits and mineral texture. Drink now for its fruitiness and crisp aftertaste.',\n",
       " \"Wiry herbal aromas of blueberry and currant lead to an acidic citrusy palate that's choppy and a bit rough. Quick-hitting plum and currant flavors are herbal before hollowing out on a zesty, tannic finish.\",\n",
       " 'This light-colored wine is attractively perfumed but with a grassy edge that suggests the fruit was underripe. Built for the short term, it will be ready from late 2017.',\n",
       " 'Cherry and cassis notes provide a touch of brighness on the nose and palate of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Cabernet Franc, 26% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, but its plum-raisin backdrop and dullness on the finish suggest it might be going downhill.',\n",
       " 'Flat and fruitless up front, this smells a bit like a haystack. Plump on the palate, with a sense of grape skins to the mouthfeel, this tastes yeasty, mildly bitter and of nonspecific white fruits.',\n",
       " 'Sour fruit, funky root beer, dried salami and asphalt aromas show on the nose of this rustic bottling. Dried fruit and espresso flavors mark the palate.',\n",
       " 'This soft, robustly ripe wine shows a raisin-like prune character, tasting somewhat chalky on the palate.',\n",
       " 'This is a thin, unfussy wine that imparts bell pepper and asparagus in a sea of green flavor.',\n",
       " 'High in ripeness and intensity, this vineyard designate overpowers with astringency as it plows through a wall of blackberry jam and chocolate flavors.',\n",
       " \"Sweet and fruity, this canned wine feels soft and syrupy, with sugary pear as the primary flavor on the palate. It's a basic white wine in a convenient package.\",\n",
